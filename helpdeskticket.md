problem: login feature not connected between front-end and back-end
-
What I expected to happen: login information (username and password), once "onclick" is invoked, will be passed to server to authenticate the user.
-
What I’ve tried: on front-end, we've tried to send the targetvalue as username and password to back-end to test if username and password are passed properly so we can check username and password on database. Also, we checked the actions to see if we are passing actions to the Login component properly so we can invoke actions on username and password
-
Why I suspect it’s not working: Something wrong with post fetch method
-
Error message (if applicable): no error message, once we login with username and password, we just get refreshed page while login being unsuccessful.
